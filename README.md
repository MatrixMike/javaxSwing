# javaxSwing
lein Clojure

After doing git clone the command 'lein run' will run and produce a graphical output. This does not appear to generate jar or even compile the code.
Compiling the code -> lein compile works OK and lein uberjar does it's thing. Trying to run the jar file 
java -jar ...    fails 
'Error: Could not find or load main class javaxSwing.core'

Tools being used here:

lein
gitk (including git gui)
